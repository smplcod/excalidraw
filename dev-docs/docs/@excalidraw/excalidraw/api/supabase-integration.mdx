# Supabase integration

The application exposes helpers to save and load scenes using a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) backend.

```ts
import { saveToSupabase, loadFromSupabase } from "excalidraw-app/data/supabase";
```

`saveToSupabase()` returns the created row `id` which you can later use with `loadFromSupabase()` to retrieve the scene.

The helpers expect the environment variables `VITE_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to be defined.
